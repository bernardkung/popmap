
Alaska has a county that was split (Valdez-Cordova split into Chugach and Copper River).

All of Connecticut was surveyed by Planning Regions- 
  there's an announcement that these are County Equivalents,
  just need to check the cross-walking since the codes are different.

scaleQuantize doesn't work because of the massive disparity in populations between counties.
  Need a way to flatten the spread, try binning into percentiles maybe?
