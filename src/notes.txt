
Alaska has a county that was split (Valdez-Cordova split into Chugach and Copper River).

All of Connecticut was surveyed by Planning Regions- 
  there's an announcement that these are County Equivalents,
  just need to check the cross-walking since the codes are different.


scaleQuantize doesn't work because of the massive disparity in populations between counties.
  Need a way to flatten the spread, try binning into percentiles maybe?
  >> Swapped to a ten quantile scale

  
Swapped to a 2022 geo data
Projected to make it show up, but it still clips
Reworked the margins fixed the clipping, 
    just need to take a closer look to understand how the margins work

Connecticut is rendering correctly now with the swap to 2022 geodata

Need to figure out how to get Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico into the viewbox
Fixed Alaska and Hawaii by swapping to GeoAlbersUsa, 
tried  a PR solution, doesn't quite work, doesn't seem worth to fix
