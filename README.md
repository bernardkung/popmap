# US Population Comparison

Little fun project for comparing the populations of US counties. Check it out on github pages: https://bernardkung.github.io/popmap/

## Instructions

Right click to set an active county. Left click to select a county to start building a set of counties with an equivalent population from. There's also a few choices of algorithm for building the set of equivalent counties.

## Data

Data is sourced from the 2023 US census data.

## Issues

There's a county in Hawaii that's connected to an "invisible" county.

Alaska and Hawaii need a connection to the continuous 48.

Map needs zooming/movement.

Elements don't respond to window size.
